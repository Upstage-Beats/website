<p>You are responsible for arranging your own access to the website and any service provider charges that may be incurred.</p>

We will report any such breach to the relevant law enforcement authorities and we will co-operate with those authorities by disclosing your identity to them.

<h3>5. Complaints</h3>

<h2>Buying Beats On UpstageBeats</h2>
<h3>6. Conditions Of Sale</h3>
<p>Compositions and recordings (Beats) are made available by third parties (Producers) through our platforms. UpstageBeats requires all Producers to confirm that the Producer’s Beats do not infringe any third party rights and that they have the necessary permissions to make the Beats available and grant ongoing rights to purchasers.</p>
<p>UpstageBeats provide a platform for the Producers to sell their Beats. As a purchaser, your contractual relationship relating to Beats is with the licensor or seller of Beats and not with UpstageBeats.</p>
<p>When you purchase Beats, it will be under the conditions and limitations of the license terms stipulated by the website. These terms will be presented prior to completing the purchase of a Beat. If you do not agree to those license terms, you must not purchase that Beat. Any exploitation of Beats by a purchaser which is outside of the Producer’s license terms will be a potential breach of contract and a potential breach of intellectual property rights, for which you will be liable.</p>
<h3>7. Purchaser obligations</h3>
<p>We wish to promote an environment where people can share their music and be properly remunerated for their work. By accessing our website, you agree that you shall not breach another party’s intellectual property rights and that you will adhere to the terms of any license agreement.</p>
<p>In the event that in our reasonable belief a party breaches these terms, any Producer license terms or infringes ours or a Producer’s intellectual property rights we reserve the right (without limiting any other rights and remedies) to immediately terminate or suspend your account and share your account details (including personal information) with the relevant rights holder or authorities.</p>
<p>You shall indemnify us against any and all direct and indirect claims, losses, damages, costs and liabilities arising out of any infringement by you or permitted by of a Producer’s rights.</p>
<h3>8. Lease Information</h3>
<p>You will receive an MP3 or WAV file (depending on your purchase) and a download for the song file will be delivered within 24 hours. You have full rights to record, alter, mix the beat/song in any shape, way, or form except for reselling the beat. In the event of someone purchasing exclusive rights to the beat you have leased, your lease will remain intact and the beat is still yours to use. Credits must be given to the beat producer on the track unless terms are otherwise discussed with the seller. The seller still owns the beat(s) and the seller is able to resell the beat(s) to any other party until exclusive rights have been purchased.</p>
<h2>General Terms</h2>
<h3>9. Liability</h3>
<p>If we do not comply with these terms, we shall be responsible for any loss or damage which could obviously be foreseen at the time we provide our services. All other liability is excluded. Nothing in these terms affects your statutory rights.</p>
<p>We will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</p>
<p>We do not exclude any liability where it would be unlawful to do so, including for death or personal injury caused by our negligence, fraudulent behaviour or for breach of your legal rights in relation to the products. Where it is not possible to exclude liability, our aggregate liability to you shall be $100 (one-hundred Canadian dollars).</p>
<h3>10. Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>We shall be permitted transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another party.</p>
<p>You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree to this in writing.</p>
<p>No third party shall have any rights under these terms.</p>
<p>Where any of these provisions are found to be unlawful it shall, where possible, be construed to give a lawful meaning and where not possible it shall be deemed severed from these terms. The remainder of these terms shall remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>Any delay in enforcing our rights or bringing an action against you shall not be a waiver of our rights. Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later.</p>
<p>If you are a business, you irrevocably agree that the Supreme Court of British Columbia in Canada shall have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with a Contract or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims), however, nothing in these terms shall limit our right to take proceedings against you in any other court of competent jurisdiction, nor shall the taking by us of proceedings in any one or more jurisdictions preclude the taking by us of proceedings in any other jurisdictions, whether concurrently or not, to the extent permitted by the law of such other jurisdiction.</p>
